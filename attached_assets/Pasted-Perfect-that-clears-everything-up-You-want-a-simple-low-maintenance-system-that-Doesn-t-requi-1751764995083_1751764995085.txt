Perfect — that clears everything up!

You want a simple, low-maintenance system that:

Doesn’t require messing with Gilbarco internals.
Uses Modisoft’s end-of-day transaction report (received via email or file).
Automatically parses that file, identifies suspicious transactions (e.g., voids, refunds, no-sales).
Uses timestamps to locate and clip video from your camera system.
Saves those clips to a web-based dashboard that you can access from both web and Android (and iPhone via browser).
Lets you review, score, and flag suspicious activity without installing anything.
✅ Here's the Solid Plan You Can Build

We'll break this into 4 components:

📂 1. FILE HANDLING (Modisoft Daily Report)
You (or the system) upload the CSV or Excel file you get from Modisoft.
The system parses that file and filters for:
VOID
NO SALE
REFUND
DISCOUNT REMOVED
Extract:
Timestamp
Cashier ID / Register
Transaction type
Transaction ID or pump # (if available)
🎥 2. VIDEO CLIP MATCHING (Camera Playback)
Your cameras run 24/7 recording to a local NAS or cloud storage.
Each video file is named or timestamped.
When a suspicious transaction is detected:
Match it with the corresponding camera footage (based on timestamp).
Extract a short clip (e.g. 5 seconds before and 10 after).
Save as: VOID_07-05-2025_13-24-Cashier3.mp4
Tech stack options:

Use FFmpeg to cut from raw video files.
Save clip in a folder like /clips/2025-07-05/.
🌐 3. WEB + MOBILE VIEWER (Dashboard)
Build a web app (that works on Android and iPhone via browser):

Login Page (optional if internal use only)
Clip List with filters:
Date, Cashier, Transaction Type
Video Player + Metadata Panel
Agent Buttons:
✅ OK
⚠️ Review
❌ Fraud
Optional Comments or Tagging
Tech stack:

Frontend: React.js or simple HTML + Bootstrap (Replit compatible)
Backend: Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express)
Database: SQLite or Firebase (for simplicity)
Hosting: Replit, Vercel, or any VPS (later move to Android if needed)
🧠 4. SCORING, AUDIT & EXPORT
Store every flagged clip + review decision.
Build a “Reports” page:
Show fraud by cashier, time of day, etc.
Allow exporting data:
CSV of flagged events with links to video.

✅ What You Need to Start

✅ A sample CSV or Excel file from Modisoft
(You can upload it here or describe the structure)
✅ Location of your camera footage or sample naming convention
(e.g., do your files look like 2025-07-05-13-25.mp4?)
📦 Deliverables I Can Build for You:

✅ Replit-ready Python Flask + HTML UI
✅ Script to parse Modisoft file and identify bad transactions
✅ FFmpeg script to extract matching clips
✅ Web dashboard that lists and plays clips
✅ Mobile-friendly layout (no app needed)
