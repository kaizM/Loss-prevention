Yes — you're absolutely right.

🎯 **Giving direct access to the Alibi Cloud (or RTSP stream) and pulling the clip automatically is 100% the smarter way**. That saves you from:

* Downloading huge 24-hour files
* Manually uploading/exporting clips
* Managing video storage manually

## ✅ NEW PLAN (Alibi Cloud + Modisoft)

Here’s the streamlined version based on what you just said:

---

### 🧠 System Logic Overview

1. **At end of day**:

   * Upload or email the **Modisoft report** (CSV/Excel).

2. **System parses it**:

   * Finds suspicious transactions: `VOID`, `NO SALE`, `REFUND`, etc.
   * Extracts timestamp + cashier info.

3. **For each suspicious entry**:

   * Connects to your **Alibi Cloud or RTSP camera**.
   * Pulls a **small clip** (e.g., 15 seconds) around the event timestamp.

4. **Saves clip**:

   * Uploads to your secure cloud folder (or web dashboard).
   * Tags it with cashier, time, type.

5. **You view via Web Dashboard**:

   * ✅ Clean | ⚠️ Suspicious | ❌ Fraud
   * All mobile and web-accessible — no app needed.

## 🎥 HOW TO PULL CLIPS DIRECTLY (NO FILE DOWNLOADS)

### 🔹 Option 1: **Alibi Cloud Access (Preferred)**

* If your Alibi system supports **Cloud login / Web API**, we can:

  * Authenticate with your Alibi credentials or access token
  * Use time range (`2025-07-05 13:24:16`) to request a **clip via API**
  * Save that clip automatically in MP4 format

> 🔐 Let me know what exact Alibi model/NVR you use and if it supports:

* **Alibi Cloud Web access**
* **CMS software (like Alibi Witness / Alibi Cloud VS)**
* **ONVIF** or **RESTful API access**

---

### 🔹 Option 2: **Direct RTSP Pull from Camera/NVR**

If Cloud access isn’t possible, then you can still use:

```
rtsp://username:password@ip_address:port/stream1
```

* FFmpeg can directly connect to this and extract a 15-sec clip:

  * From: `transaction_time - 5s`
  * To: `transaction_time + 10s`
* No download needed, only the clip is saved.

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (Still Simple)

```
/modisoft_reports/
   report_2025-07-05.csv

/clips/
   VOID_13-24_cashier3.mp4
   NO_SALE_15-12_cashier1.mp4
```

---

## ✅ What You Need to Provide

So I can fully build this out and give you the final ready-to-run system, please provide:

1. ✅ **Modisoft sample CSV** (just one day is fine)

2. ✅ The **Alibi cloud login method**:

   * Do you have a **web dashboard**?
   * Or an **Alibi CMS desktop app**?
   * Or can you get the **RTSP stream URL**?

3. ✅ (Optional) If available, one **test timestamp** to verify with video (e.g., “Cashier 3, VOID at 13:24”)

---

Once you send that, I’ll deliver:

* 🎁 A Replit-ready app you can copy-paste
* 🎥 Pulls clips from Alibi cloud or RTSP
* 📊 Dashboard for clip review (web/mobile friendly)

**Ready when you are — just upload the Modisoft file and confirm your Alibi setup.**
